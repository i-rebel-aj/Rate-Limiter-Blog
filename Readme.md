### Rate Limiters

This repo contains a very very basic implementations of Rate limiters using 5 algorithms 
with some minor benchmarks.

I also intend to explore cloud offerings with same

This is meant for educational purposes only

For detailed explanation please refer to the blog comming soon

This does not handle rate limits across distributed systems right now, and does not use in memory DB like redis. 

Everything currently is kept in the process heap memory

Implemented algorithms:

1. Token Bucket Algorithm
